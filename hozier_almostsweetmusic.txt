Hozier Lyrics
"Almost (Sweet Music)"
I came in from the outside, burnt out from a joyride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight
That was my heart, the drums that start off night and day
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
Tell me who and I'll be thanking 'em
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing?
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know
The very thought of you and am I blue
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh the radio newsreader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me, awake, and ask, 'Is everything alright?'
And, Lord, I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Noah Kahan - "Sink"
Oh, she hates to say goodbye
So she only says goodnight
When she goes, she stops to look behind
And I'll sink
Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh no, yeah, summer...
Kacey Musgraves - "Slow Burn"
Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over...
King Princess - "Talia"
Hey, my love
I buried you a month or two ago
I keep thinking that you're standing on my floor
That you're waiting there for me
Hey, my love
You've walked out a hundred times, how was I
Supposed to...
The Band CAMINO - "See Through"
You know how to keep me waiting
You know there's a call that you missed
You know that I get impatient
'Cause I know you saw that shit

You got me on the back burn, baby
You got me staying up all...
James Bay - "Chew On My Heart"
Take your time, I'll be right here
I know no one could ever love me better
Take all night, you're the truth that is breaking me
And keeping me together, together

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so...
