Hozier Lyrics
"NFWMB"
When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem
It slouched and then
Must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you, the best of you
Honey, belongs to me
Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
If I was born as a black thorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you, held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies
Ain't it warming you, the world goin' up in flames?
Ain't it the life where you you're lighting off the blaze?
Ain't it a waste it watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

The sun, it rises slowly as you walk

What a strange being you are, God knows where I would be

Nothing But Thieves - "Take This Lonely Heart"
I feel younger everyday 
The more I grow 
The less I seem to know

Remember the words you told me

Surrender my everything
