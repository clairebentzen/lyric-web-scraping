Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"BLOOD."
[Bēkon:]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost... your life."
[Bēkon:]
Is it wickedness?
[Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle:]
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'..."
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.
