Hozier Lyrics
"Lay Me Down"
(originally by Sam Smith)
Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you
And it's hard
These days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars
Are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story
Told me not to cry when you were gone
Enough with this feeling, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
Next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you like crazy, like crazy, like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
Enough with this feeling, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
Next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight...
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
Next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
Next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Yeah, I know that I have got this all wrong

She feels her heart begin to swell

Blue is all I've ever really known
Playing records that I couldn't own

Walking slow to save a lonely night

Unable to pay my rent

I'm sick to death of eating breakfast on my own
Starting out my daily blues (hmmm)
I'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone (ooh)
Scrolling through pictures of you
I'd like to say that maybe...
