Hozier Lyrics
"First Light"
One bright morning changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathing
You wake
Your eyes open at first a thousand miles away
But turning shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believing in
Could this be how every day begins?
The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
One bright morning goes so easy
Darkness always
Finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to calling out your name
But after this I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again
The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

Matt Maeson - "Waltz Right In"
Well, inside the steeple praised all of the people
And summer, it shined with a sheen
As we tumbled around in a terrible town
Till we left to remember the trees

Mama's just thinkin' while Daddy's...
Noah Kahan - "Growing Sideways"
So I took my medication and I poured my trauma out
On some sad-eyed, middle-aged man's overpriced new leather couch
And we argued about Jesus, finally found some middle ground
I said, "I'm cured"...
The 1975 - "Be My Mistake"
Be my mistake and turn out the light
She bought me those jeans, the ones you like
I don't wanna hug, I just wanna sleep
The smell of your hair reminds me of her feet

So don't wait outside my hotel...
Harry Styles - "Sweet Creature"
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going but we know where we belong

And ohhhh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard...
The Lumineers - "Stubborn Love"
She'll lie and steal, and cheat, and beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care

When...
