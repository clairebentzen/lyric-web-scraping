Hozier Lyrics
"Why Would You Be Loved"
It's only said to be kind the time that you have with love
You're never told but you're loaned it
It's a lie, the high that you have with love
It feels like gold when you hold it
And know it's sweet, to know when it's gone, baby
So why, why, why
Why would you be lovin'? Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? yeah
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Now the world falls apart, it starts when they're acting up
I wouldn't say it, but I blame them
Bleedin' hearts we are to that other stuff, all the same motivations
We'll melt away like snowflakes on a tongue, baby
So why, why, why
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you, why would you
Why would you play it all on somethin' as hollow as trust (hey)
What if you gave it all to find that it wasn't enough? (Hey)
What if under the gaze of 'em, you come short when the goin' gets rough?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? hey, hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
They look for somethin' to be done for those that are most in pain
What about me and my achin'?
The scales we hung, the breakin' of hook and chain?
What about me and my breakin'?
If you wait so long, how could you try it all, baby?
So why, why, why
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?, yeah
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you, why would you
Why would you play it all on somethin' as hollow as trust?
What if you gave it all, to find that it wasn't enough?
What if under the gaze of 'em, you come short when the goin' gets rough?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?

Can't remember the last time we kissed

It's all about confidence baby
