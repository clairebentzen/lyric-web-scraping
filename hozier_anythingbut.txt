Hozier Lyrics
"Anything But"
C'mere to me. I wish I was a may fly on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight just sitting on The Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in The Liffey
In a shot I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliff side top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood
Or better yet I'd cause a drought
If I was a rip tide
I wouldn't take you out
I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do anything if you'd hear me say
Go look another way
Look another way
Look, I wanna be loud
So loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rain stick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede
You wouldn't get a kick
I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand, and then you fly away together
If I had his job
You would live forever
I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
I would do anything if you'd hear me say
Go look another way
Look another way
I don't wanna be anything, be anything
But I would do anything (Go look another way)
I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Don't wanna be anything, anything
Go look another way
Look another way

Maisie Peters - "The Good Witch"
Still me here, d'you think I forgot about you
Still upset, but now I'm twenty two
Let's call this, the calm before the storm comes rushing through
And it's Armageddon
Still decoy, still a good witch...
Lorde - "Royals"
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose,...
Vance Joy - "Riptide"
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh, oh, and they...
Lana Del Rey - "Young And Beautiful"
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with...
The Lumineers - "Ophelia"
Ah, ah, when I was younger, I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse, and you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend, he feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse,...
