Hozier Lyrics
"Arsonist's Lullabye"
[Humming]
When I was a child, I heard voices...
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices...
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power,
Could barely tear my eyes away
All you have is your fire...
And the place you need to reach -
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash
[Humming]
When I was 16, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me...
I knew the scent was mine alone
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash
When I was a man I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake
All you have is your fire,
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons,
But always keep 'em on a leash...

Sleeping At Last - "Neptune"
Pitch black, pale blue,
It was a stained glass
Variation of the truth
And I felt empty handed.

You let me set sail
With cheap wood.
So I patched up
Every leak that I could,
'Til the blame grew too...
Daughter - "Numbers"
Take the worst situations
Make a worse situation
Follow me home, pretend you
Found somebody to mend you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

Matt Maeson - "Me And My Friends Are Lonely"
I can't open up to you
Me and my friends are lonely
I don't know what to do
I always figured I'd be the one to die alone

I cope smothered in smoke
Dehydrate my soul
I know things that you don't
I've...
King Princess - "1950"
I hate it when dudes try to chase me
But I love it when you try to save me
'Cause I'm just a lady
I love it when we play 1950
It's so cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me
I'm surprised when you...
The Paper Kites - "Arms"
What can I give that is all of me?
My heart's not good cause it's split in two
What can I give that is all for you?
These arms are all I have

But I hold you like I do love you
But I hold you like I...
