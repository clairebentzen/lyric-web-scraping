Hozier Lyrics
"Nobody"
You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I'll wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though everywhere I go
And I've done everything and I've been everywhere, you know
I've been fed gold
By sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I danced real slow
With Rockettes on dodgy Molly
But I've had no love like your love
Ooh from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love
Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand or the soothing of your voice
At first chance
I'd take the bed warmed by the body
I once warmed my hands
Over a burning Maserati
But I've had no love like your love
From nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love
And on the other side, why should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do I've had no love like your love

Thanks to Mia for correcting these lyrics.

Hozier told about this song,
"It's just taking into account how flawed this person is and saying, 'Look, it's the best we have at the moment.' It's one of the closest things to a road song that I've written."
These lyrics contain a couple of references to MDMA (exstasy), when the singer tells about his crazy night out, e.g. he was involved in dancing under the influence and feels suicidal when the drug effect begins to fade away.

All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom

Time to let it go
It won't let go of me
Hanging by a thread
Cutting the cord and then falling back into the
