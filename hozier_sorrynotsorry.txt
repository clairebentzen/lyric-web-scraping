Hozier Lyrics
"Sorry Not Sorry"
(originally by Demi Lovato)
I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse
Now, you're out here lookin' like regret, ain't too proud to beg
Second chance, you'll never get
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse
(Payback is a bad)
(And baby, I'm the baddest)
(You with a savage)
Can't have this, can't have this, ah
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya
Nah
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that this burns
Baby, fineness is the way to kill
Tell me how it feels, bet it's such a bitter pill
And yeah I know, you thought you had bigger, better things
Bet right now this stings
'Cause the grass is greener under me
Bright as Technicolor, I can tell that you can see
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse
('Cause payback is a bad)
(And baby, I'm the baddest)
(You with a savage)
Can't have this, can't have this, ah
It'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya
But nah
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry) (Baby, baby)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
(Feel your love,
[?]
)
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry) (Baby, baby)
Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
(Feel your love,
[?]
)
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that this burns
(Hey girl)
Baby, fineness is the way to kill
(Ain't no mystery)
It's such a bitter pill
(Then leave)
I have bigger, better
(As far as I can see)
Ah, this stings
(I wanna keep you here)
Grass is greener under me
(Laying next to me)
I can tell that you can see
(Sharing our love)
It hurts to see me like this
(Between the sheets)
It gets worse (Oh, oh, oh)
Payback is a bad
Baby, I'm the baddest
With a savage
Can't have this, can't have this, ah (Ah, ah, baby)
It'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya
Nah
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (Not sorry) (Baby, baby)
Ah, ah, feel your love surrounding me
Oh, oh, oh (Not sorry)
Baby, baby (Not sorry, not sorry)
Feel your love between the sheets
Oh, oh, oh (Not sorry)
Baby, baby (Not sorry)
Feel your love surrounding me
Oh, oh, oh (Not sorry)
Baby, baby (Not sorry, not sorry)
Feel your love between the sheets
