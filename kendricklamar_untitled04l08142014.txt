Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Untitled 04 L 08.14.2014."
[SZA (Kendrick Lamar):]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool)
[SZA (Kendrick Lamar):]
(But) head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...)
Come on give me some help, hey
Head is the answer, do it for the future, girl
[Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA:]
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
[Lance Skiiiwalker:]
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight up
[SZA:]
Head is the future

Ab-Soul - "Kendrick Lamar's Interlude"
24/7, 365, motherfucker, I'm still right on time
Oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you my Plan B is to win your hearts...
Kanye West - "Famous"
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock For all my Southside...
Miguel - "Do You..."
Do you like drugs?

Have you ever felt alone?
Do you still believe in love?

But do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too, me too, me too, babe
Me too, me too
Do you like love, do you...
Earl Sweatshirt - "Chum"
Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt
Get up...
ASAP Ferg - "Let It Bang"
Grandma hid that hammer in her mattress from my uncle
He would listen to Wu-Tang fore walking in the jungle
Army... jacket, kitchen knife, hope he don't cut you
With a deuce-deuce up in his boot in...
