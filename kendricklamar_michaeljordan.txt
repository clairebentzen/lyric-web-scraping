Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Michael Jordan"
(feat. Schoolboy Q)
[Alori Joh:]
I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, every time I'm in my city, I be acting like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26's, I'm a vanity slave
I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
I'm a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A. that nigga, don't wuwwy!
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
I'm popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don't know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)
Every time I'm in my city, I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can't tell you about the world homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it "Hall Of Fame" once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life's a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me
Every time I'm in my city, I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that
[Schoolboy Q:]
I remember tripping, walking through the set
Like my Glock don't think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don't know why you sucker niggas can't see
I'm from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I'm gon' turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep, you left alone, y-y-you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts 'round and 'round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her 'round and 'round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout 'til I'm done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy' crazy, her pussy crazy
You fuck niggas!
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Every time I'm in my city, I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World". Hello, world. Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
