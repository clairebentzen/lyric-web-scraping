Hozier Lyrics
"I Could Be Yours"
I could be soft and sweet
I could be hard and loud
I could be anything
You ever need somehow
Why don't you hear me sing
Out from the lost and found
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours
Why don't you try on me
Why don't you take me home
I'll match the color scheme
Of your bedroom walls
Oh, take a dose of me
It doesn't hurt at all
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours
Oh God, I'd benefit
From your sweet tenderness
Thank God it could've been
'Cause nothing comes from it
That'd be a helpful thought
If I could remember it, but
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours
