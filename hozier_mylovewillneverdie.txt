Hozier Lyrics
"My Love Will Never Die"
You've done
Me wrong
For a long
Long time
But after all
You've done
I never changed
My mind
Honey please
Try to love me
Honey please
Honey try
My love will never die
Flowers
Flowers grow
Where I'm laid
To rest
Honey pick
A blossom
And hold it
Hold it
To your breast
Honey you know
That's my love
Bursting loud
From inside
My love
Oh my love my love
Will never die

The end of the after
The weight of a war
The kindness gone to bed
The weight of your laughter
Alive in the hall

Living without her
Living at all...
The Head And The Heart - "Honeybee"
Honeybee
Could you imagine where our lives would lead
That silly ring, it wasn't meant to be
Luckily you saw in me
Something I couldn't see

I carry the time we don't talk
In a back pack
Leave it on the side with the nights you didn't
Call me back

And all the ideas, and the hope
I'd never ask him for
I'll throw them away, it's okay,...
