Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"My Mind Drifts"
As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
The cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Ha ha LMFAO
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain phantom
See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I interact with the inner-city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap

Walkin' with my back to the Sun, keep my head to the sky
