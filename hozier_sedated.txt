Hozier Lyrics
"Sedated"
Just a little rush, babe
To feel dizzy, to derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe
My veins are busy but my heart's in atrophy
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Something isn't right, babe
I keep catching little words but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe
I keep scratching but somehow I can't get in
So we're slaves to any semblance of touch
Lord we should quit but we love it too much
Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Darlin', don't you, stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it
Darlin', don't you, join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Bad Suns - "Cardiac Arrest"
I’ve been tryin’ to keep my grip, yeah I think I’m over this
I can hear it now, oh no, oh no-o
Yeah my tongue will let it slip, why’d I do those things I did

BANKS - "Goddess"
She gave it all, you gave her shit
She coulda done, just anything
Or anyone, cause she's a goddess
You never got this
You put her down, you liked her hopeless
To walk around, feeling unnoticed
You...
Vance Joy - "Georgia"
She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul, oh

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed

Glass Animals - "Holiest"
Climb until you're getting high
Be a part of the scene like you're living your dream
Walk the room like you're on fire

The Wombats - "Emoticons"
It's tough to stay objective, baby
With your tongue abseiling down my neck
It's a bulletproof offer and I can't accept
It's tough to maintain focus, baby
Now all my elephants are in the room
We crave...
