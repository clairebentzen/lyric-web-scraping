Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Untitled 06 L 06.30.2014."
[Kendrick Lamar:]
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me
[Kendrick Lamar (CeeLo Green):]
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
(I can explain)
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
(Let me explain)
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
(I can explain)
Oh shando! I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer
(Let me explain)
[CeeLo Green:]
I'm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive, you're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make-believe?
Anything you want to know
(I can explain)
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby (Let me explain)
I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me a while? (I can explain)
Let me explain it, ah yes (Let me explain)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themselves and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
'Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are
[Kendrick Lamar (CeeLo Green):]
(I can explain)
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand-washing your clothes on Sunday
(Let me explain)
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed the mind and soul
(I can explain)
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
(Let me explain)
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
(Let me explain)
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
(I can explain)
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd
I am yours
(I can explain)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
