Hozier Lyrics
"Would That I"
True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
Willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicos
Over canopy dapple long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weeping of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire but that was long ago
And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby
With the roar of the fire my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose I was never the same
Watching still living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Laying waste to my loving long ago
But that's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright, honey (Oooh)
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby
So in awe there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I loved" is long ago
And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to
Oh, you're good to me
You're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

Hozier explained the song to Apple Music,
"It's about somebody characterising all of their past romances, people that they cared for, as trees they took shelter under, and describing a would-be jealous lover as fire that ultimately burns that wood..."
He added,
"But there's a weirdly elaborate pun in it: 'would that I' is like a way of saying 'I wish that I did'. It's a pun on all the wood that I've loved."

Vampire Weekend - "Campus"
I wake up, my shoulders cold
I've got to leave here, before I go
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor...
Of Monsters And Men - "Crystals"
Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground

I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows...
Colony House - "You Know It"
Take that picture from that frame
I put it in my pocket so that every day you're with me
I keep you close to my heart
Give me one more kiss before the boys arrive
Nashville to San Francisco is a hell...
Bleachers - "Goodmorning"
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
One foot out and I know the weight is coming
Because I left it by the bed last night
Open my eyes and I stare and pray for light
Always one foot out when you say...
COIN - "Let It All Out (10:05)"
When you love something but you've had enough
When you hold someone but you're losing touch
You're rubbing salt deep in the cut
Oh I-I-I

Every move you make is apocalypse
And you feel your fate at...
