Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Tammy's Song (Her Evils)"
Don't judge me
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
And she got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—
Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man, she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—
Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his pockets, found condoms by
Magnum, and the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started drivin' on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon'
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—
And so these girls, these vulnerable girls
Took their men up, put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world
And just like that, it was only gettin', got their feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound? They got fed up with the biggest question mark
They're curious now
'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go
Fuck with other bitches when they're tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they're tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas—
Tammy's song
