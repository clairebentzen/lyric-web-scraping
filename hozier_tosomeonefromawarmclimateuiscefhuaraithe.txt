Hozier Lyrics
"To Someone From A Warm Climate (Uiscefhuaraithe)"
A joy hard-learned in winter was the warming of the bed
You'd shake for minutes there and move your legs
Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within
Let your breath heat the air until you'd feel it getting thin
'Uiscefhuaraithe'
The feel of coldness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That come natural as a dream you didn't know that you were in
And darling, all my dreaming
Is only put to shame
And darling, all my dreaming
Has only been given a name
But it came easy, darling
As natural as another leg around you in the bed frame
In summer's heat, I learned to dread the coming of the night
The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls
'Uiscefhuaraithe'
The feel of coolness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That God in his awful wisdom just programs in
But darling, all my dreaming
Is only put to shame
And darling, all my dreaming
Has only been given a name
But it happened easy
Natural as another leg around you in the bed
And I wish I could say
That the river of my arms have found the ocean
And I wish I could say the cold lake water of my heart
Christ, it's boiling over
But it happened easy, darling
Natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

Ever since I was a young boy, running through grass
I was a dreamer writing stories down the back of the class
Now I sit at this piano with my heart in my hands
Take my love and all my loss and get...
Billie Eilish - "What Was I Made For?"
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out, I'm not real
Just...
The 1975 - "She Lays Down"
She lays down on a bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her love
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun has gone
She'd like to love her...
Matt Corby - "Brother"
Ooh ooh ooh...

Sleep now under my skin
Make sure you’ll try to
Conjure the wind
And ease my mind

Ooh ooh ooh...

Somebody call out to your brother
He’s calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with...
