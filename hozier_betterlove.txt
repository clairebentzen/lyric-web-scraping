"Better Love" lyrics
Hozier Lyrics
"Better Love"
(from "The Legend Of Tarzan" soundtrack)
I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still, of every chill
Chided by that silence of a hush sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine
Staring in the blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are, unknown we are
To the wild and to the both of us
I confessed the longing I was dreaming of
Some better love, but there's no better love
Beckons above me and there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love
I have never loved a darker blue
Than the darkness I have known in you, own from you
You, whose heart would sing of anarchy
You, who'd laugh at meaning's guarantee,
So beautifully
When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory, witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
We'll live eternally
Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

Baby 
It's been a long day,
Baby 
Things ain't been going my way

To clear my mind

What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way

Aquilo - "Never Seen You Get So Low"
Slow down, you don't need to move
Fall down, you don't have to lose yourself over this

Head up in the clouds
Taking turns to shout
Your word is a melody
Just take some time to breathe
Memories take...
The Japanese House - "Saw You In A Dream"
I saw you in a dream
You had stayed the same
You were beckoning me
Said that I had changed
Tried to keep my eyes closed
I want you so bad
Then I awoke and it was so sad

Haven't talked to you in...
Young The Giant - "Superposition"
I don't believe in fate
No psychic vision
But when things fall into place
Superposition

In any universe
You are my dark star

I want you
To want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we...
