Hozier Lyrics
"Sweet Thing"
(originally by Van Morrison)
I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first
I will drink clear clean water for to quench my thirst
I'll go watch the ferry-boats and I'll get high
On the bluer ocean against the waters sky
I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
I will never ever ever grow so old again
Oooh good God you're a sweet thing
Oooh good God you're a sweet thing
I shall drive my chariot down - your streets and cry
Hey it's me tonight I'm dynamite and I don't know why
You shall take me strongly in your arms again
And I still wonder if I ever felt the pain
We shall walk and talk in gardens all misty wet with rain
And I shall never, ever, ever grow so cold again
Oooh good God you're a sweet thing
Oooh good God you're a sweet thing
I shall raise my hand up into the night, to the night sky
And count the stars that are shining in your eye
Just to dig it all and not to wonder that would be fine
You're satisfied not to read in between the lines
Oooh good God you're a sweet thing
Oooh good God you're a sweet thing
Oooh my my my my my sweet thing
Oooh good God.
