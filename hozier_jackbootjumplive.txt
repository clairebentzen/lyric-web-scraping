Hozier Lyrics
"Jackboot Jump (Live)"
At Standing Rock the Jackboot Jump
You'd swear was all the rage
Whether tearing up old treaties
Or just tearing up the place
It's always corporate infrastructure
Over the structure of your face
In Moscow the Jackboot show
Has so much in store
For any silly student
Who doesn't wanna learn the score
So the Moscow Jackboot Ballet
Finds some scared young dancing floor
In Hong Kong it won't be long
'Til they have to fall in line
For the long hand of Beijing
Stretching south a thousand miles
Where they rock the Jackboot Jump there
Like that shit's going out of style
All around the world
You'd think that things were looking rough
But the jackboot only jumps down
On people standing up
So you know good things are happening
When the jackboot needs to jump

Phoebe Bridgers - "Smoke Signals"
I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
"Walden" it with you
Any longer, it would have got old
Singing "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But...
Sara Bareilles - "Poetry By Dead Men"
By the time you hear this
I'll be in the rear view mirror
I'll even wear that green dress you like
So when I disappear
You can turn around
One last look
At the girl you lost in the time you took

Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
(That's wild, that'll be nuts)

There's something in the water
I don't like the flavour, I don't like the taste
Searching for nirvana
Something that'll...
