Hozier Lyrics
"Someone New"
Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escape the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

Mumford & Sons - "The Cave"
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you...
alt-J - "Breezeblocks"
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine your fever's gripped me again
Never kissesâ€”all you ever send are full stops, la, la, la

Do you...
Milky Chance - "Flashed Junk Mind"
We were young souls 
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds 
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine 
I feel your heartbeat
All the time

And we were bound to the city life...
Catfish And The Bottlemen - "Hourglass"
You know when you're gone I struggle at night
Dreams of you fucking me all the time
And I know you're tied up
And I know your phone's fucked
I'm craving your calls like a soldier's wife

I wanna...
George Ezra - "Hold My Girl"
I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
'Bout everything that you're going through
My girl you've got nothing to lose

Cold nights
And the Sunday mornings
On your way and out...
