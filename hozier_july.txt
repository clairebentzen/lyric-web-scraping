Hozier Lyrics
"July"
Winter worn me out like I was Prada
Threw up on me when the night was through
You can keep a dream in your mind
Only to find it's the hope that was killing you
But you arrived like sunlight in the gloom
And burned off the haze when the year was still new
Keeping me going how you show up like July
July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July
July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that it's getting me through
And you can go to work
Until your disaster, babe
Build your temple the sound and stone
Put in all of the time
Only to find
By the end that your god has flown
Or all alone he sank like a stone
Took root where he fell and started to grow
Blooming beyond us like the promise of July
July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July
July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
July
July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July
July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
July
July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things you do
And July
July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through

The Lumineers - "Ophelia"
Ah, ah, when I was younger, I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse, and you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend, he feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse,...
Coldplay - "Yellow"
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So then I...
Alex Warren - "Before You Leave Me"
Darling, handle me with care
Cover me in bubble wrap
I'm scared you really mean it, that you're never coming back
See your bag right by the stairs
I guess you're already packed
Know I can't change...
Sabrina Carpenter - "Feather"
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Oh, not another take

Oh, it's like that
I'm your dream come true
when it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back
When...
Wallows - "Are You Bored Yet?"
"What's wrong?" you've been asking
But I don't have an answer
How come, I'm still thinking
Let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that...
