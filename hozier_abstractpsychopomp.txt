Hozier Lyrics
"Abstract (Psychopomp)"
Sometimes it returns
Like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world
The streets looking brand new
I will not be great
But I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late
I'm still glad I met you
The memory hurts
But does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket
To keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road
Its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose
The Earth from a distance
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
Sometimes there's a thought
Like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to nought
When I look back through it
I remember the view
Street lights in the dark blue
The moment I knew
I'd no choice but to love you
The speed that you moved
The screech of the cars
The creature still moving
That slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes
Gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light
The Earth from a distance
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
Darling, there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror
Balanced there between those eyes
See how it shines
See how it shines

Maya Hawke - "Luna Moth"
I put my foot down on a luna moth
In the bathroom at your party
You screamed into my terrycloth
I said that I was sorry
You found me with a door locked
I only went upstairs to cry
I came over here to...
Noah Kahan & Post Malone - "Dial Drunk (Duet Version)"
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't taking any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I...
The 1975 - "Somebody Else"
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with...
Labrinth & Zendaya - "The Feels"
I got hit by a truck, I got hit by a truck
And it drove off and left me here for dead
A long night here cryin' in the rain, yeah

I got touched by God and it fucked me up
Like an electrical current...
Mumford & Sons - "The Cave"
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you...
