Hozier Lyrics
"Moment's Silence (Common Tongue)"
When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on me
When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on me
Since it all begun
To its reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me
Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me
So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

I could spend ages reading the news
I could spend days, singing the blues
But I turn up the tv light
Give up without a fight
Better than pretending to know what's wrong and what's right

KALEO - "I Can't Go On Without You"
Well they thought they were made for each other
Only thinking of one another
Never thinking just for one second
She would take a different attraction

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't...
The Head And The Heart - "All We Ever Knew"
When I wake up in the morning
I see nothing
For miles and miles and miles
When I sleep in the evening
Oh Lord
There she goes
Only in dreams, she's only in dreams

Well, well my love
We've been here...
Peach Pit - "Alrighty Aphrodite"
Take a seat back in your clamshell
If the oceans not enough, nor am I
Rollin in, I feel a dark swell
Crawling up the skin of my spine

If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd a let you waste another guy...
K.Flay - "Bad Vibes"
You got a new tattoo
Dead on arrival, typed out plainly
You only like bad news
Sleep in your coffin like a baby
Beautiful trees outside
Sky is a bright blue you see storm clouds
Storm clouds
