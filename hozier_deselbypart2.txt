Hozier Lyrics
"De Selby (Part 2)"
What you're given
What you live in
Darling, it finds a way to live in you
And your heart, love
Has such darkness
I feel it in the corners of the room
(If I was any closer)
After the gloom
(I could only lose me)
I wanna lose me, I
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer)
If I was any closer
(I could only lose me)
I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
No more than I was or than I
Want to be when you fall on me like night
Every time
And I want to be so far from sight and mind
I wanna kill the lights
I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done
Let all time slow
Let all light go
I don't need to know where we begin and end
I'd still know you
Not being shown you
I only need the working of my hands
(If I was any closer)
You understand
(I could only lose me)
I wanna lose me, I
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer)
If I was any closer
(I could only lose me)
I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
No more than I was or than I
Want to be when you fall on me like night
I wanna kill the lights
I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done
(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

Lorde - "Royals"
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose,...
Zach Bryan - "Something In The Orange"
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's...
St. Paul & The Broken Bones - "Lonely Love Song"
Death ain't what scares me
It's missing all that love that you give me
I spend most of my life proving to the world
I am worth your time

Boring love and now a boring home
Boring bed and now a boring...
James Vincent McMorrow - "Poison To You"
So what if I get too drunk?
What if I call you up?
And what if you answer?
Or what if I, what if I wait too long?
What if the light is wrong?
What if you change your tongue?

I need to hear you say...
George Ezra - "Fell In Love At The End Of The World"
You take off all your clothes and you beckon me in
And I pray I don't forget the way that this all begins
The lavender's burning, the candles are lit
There's a war outside, but it can't get us here...
