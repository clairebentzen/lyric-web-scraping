Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Untitled 08 L 09.06.2014."
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you, uh
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (broke born babies)
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho' is crazy"
And I said, "Why?"
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "Nigga, you fucked up"
You're banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you're crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you're looking for dope
These days ain't no compromise
And your pain ain't mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain't shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey
Pimp pimp (hooray!)
