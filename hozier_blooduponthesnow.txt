"Blood Upon The Snow" lyrics
Hozier & Bear McCreary Lyrics
"Blood Upon The Snow"
(from "God Of War: Ragnarok" soundtrack)
To all things housed in her silence
Nature offers a violence
The bear that keeps to his own line
The wolf that seeks always his own kind
The world that hardens as the harsher winter holds
The parent forced to eat its young before it grows
Every bird, gone unheard
Starving where the ground has froze
The winter sun rise, red on white
Like blood upon the snow
Like blood upon the snow
The ground walked here is a wonder
It ceases never to hunger
And all things nature's given
She takes all things back from the living
I've walked the earth and there are so few here that know
How dark the night
And just how cold the wind can blow
I've no more hunger now to see where the road will go
I've no more kept my warmth
Than blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
It's not my arms that will fail me
But this world takes more strength than it gave me
The trees deny themselves nothing that makes them grow
No rain fall, no sunshine
No blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
To all things housed in her silence
Nature offers a violence

And I'll use you as a warning sign
