Hozier Lyrics
"Run"
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eye, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie
Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery
To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she
But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep
Rushing ashore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run 'til you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Go for it

Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm

I'm an exception
It's hard to accept
Because I try to be happy
But then I forget
They tell me I need to chill
Man, it's all in your head
Maybe I'm paranoid

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so...

What can I give that is all of me?
My heart's not good cause it's split in two

I ain't got no time, no

I've got no clue what you're thinking
You move your hand away from mine
Shifty eyes and indecisions
Why does this happen every time?
