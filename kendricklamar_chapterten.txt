Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Chapter Ten"
[JaVont√©:]
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Babies from '80s don't know, know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance but the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'Member the universe used to be innocent?
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Every day that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80
Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
Vulnerability
This is your generation
Show, show your pain
