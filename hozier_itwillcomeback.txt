Hozier Lyrics
"It Will Come Back"
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that
Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps
Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to it
Honey don't feed it - it will come back
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe!
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that
I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need
Don't let me in with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to me
Honey don't feed me - I will come back
It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more!
It's a kindness you can't afford!
I want you baby tonight, as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Won't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling babe!

The Paper Kites - "Willow Tree March"
You fall through the trees
And you pray with your knees on the ground
For the things that you need
With your lust and your greed weighing down
And you weaken your love

Bleachers - "Rollercoaster"
It was summer when I saw your face
Looked like a teenage runaway
And God I never thought we'd take it that far
Some killer queen you are

Bishop Briggs - "The Way I Do"
Lay my heart down
Laid it down for you

Called to the Devil and the Devil did come

You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
Now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
