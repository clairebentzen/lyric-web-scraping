Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Look Out For Detox"
Uh, shout-out to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I'm a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There's never no I's in me
Of an odyssey, I'm a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I'm so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don't care where ya are
Just blink twice and I'm there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks 'bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killers, pimps
You ain't been around shit but your mamma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Mamma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It's gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans'
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I'ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
'Cause I'm going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don't wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J's put us in the PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
Goddamn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your goddamn barcode
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your goddamn heart go
Although I'm in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I'm being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and a stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I'm at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your career's over, he's slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I'm un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I'm a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I'm a factor and your facial
I'm a fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor's like Eddie Long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, fuck!
Told ya I was gonna fall off Q
We recording? You got that shit?
(Yeah, yeah) Ugly, our ugly ass
(Fuck all that, "Setbacks" dropping December)
Don't worry!
You are not gonna suck my dick tonight!
