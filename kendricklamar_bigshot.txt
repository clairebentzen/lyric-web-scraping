Kendrick Lamar & Travis Scott Lyrics
"Big Shot"
(from "Black Panther" soundtrack)
Wakanda, welcome
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Big shot (Hol' up, wait), peanut butter insides (No)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (Big shot, hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (Hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Sir Duckworth or Kung-Fu Kenny?
Got juice, got work, got weight, got plenty
Got them, got her, got more, got Benji, yeah
Top off, gettin' topped-off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fiddy, yeah
I hit the ceilin' and forgot about the floor, yeah
Brand so big, got my haters on the ropes, yeah
This be the wave plus I live on the coast, yeah
When I touch a bag, young nigga do the most, yeah
Mm, woo, and I Wakanda flex (Yeah)
And you know what time it is (Yeah)
But don't know what grindin' is (Yeah)
Baby, I care, baby, I swear
Only one real nigga here, only two real niggas here, yeah
Big shot (Hol' up, wait), peanut butter insides (No)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (Big shot, hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (Hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
[Travis Scott {Kendrick Lamar}:]
Big shots (Yeah), purped up, syruped up, nigga, like Pimp C
Flight suit, 'bout to slide down Space City
Top down, she down under like Iggy, yeah (It's lit)
Lockjaw when the night call too litty
Knockoff, get your rocks off, got plenty
Got rocks, got Jay's, got 'Ye, got Lenny, yeah
I need my engine, she need extensions (Yeah)
Don't be the center, attention, just play your position (Straight up)
Got my life on a yacht mission 'cause they been a vision (Yeah, yeah)
Runnin' through these waves like I'm Moses out the booth
Hop out the trees (Skrrt, skrrt), whippin' a frog and it leap
Foggy, can't breathe, Vacheron over Philippe (Alright)
Out in the street (Yeah), chill with the gang, make it sweet
Big shots (Yeah, {doo-doo-doo-doo}), forget your name like I'm Steve (Yeah)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Big shot (Hol' up, wait), peanut butter insides (No)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (Big shot, hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (Hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
