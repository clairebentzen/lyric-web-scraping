Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"HiiiPoWeR"
(feat. Alori Joh)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Huey Newton going stupid, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry, mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come save me, the Devil's working hard
He probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Bobby Seale makin' meals, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
[Alori Joh & (Kendrick Lamar):]
Every day, we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, 'cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day, we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long, but that's alright, na-na-na
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racin' with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
'Cause a riot, throw a "Molotov"
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Fred Hampton on your campus, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Thug life
