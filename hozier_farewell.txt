Hozier Lyrics
"Fare Well"
I, I wouldn't fare well
And I, I couldn't fare well
Hedgehog-under-a-van-wheel kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here trying to feel good again
And I, I wouldn't fare well
A kitten-cosy-in-the-engine type of wouldn't fare well
Dog-deep-into-the-chocolate kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here trying to feel good again
I'll take any high
Any glazing of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a falling sky
I'll be alright
Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground
And I, I wouldn't fare well
A whale-swimming-up-Sumida-Gawa wouldn't fare well
Critic-hoping-to-be-remembered wouldn't fare well
Out here trying to feel good again
I'll take any high
Any glazing of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a falling sky
I'll be alright
Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground

I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers

Zach Bryan - "Sarah's Place"
Road dogs are built for sleepin' in
I've been up since 4 am
At your worst, you're better than my better days
There ain't been no sun in LA
Since you moved out of Sarah's place

I love your mother's...

You don't have to lose your mind
Just be sure that you're on time to your next two appointments

Locks herself behind the light and spins her favorite...
Gregory Alan Isakov - "If I Go, I'm Goin"
This house
She's holding secrets
I got my change behind the bed

In a coffee can
I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave

And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go...

I wanna take you everywhere I go
Have you by my side

Drive across state lines

Into our front room
I could be the same old light for...
