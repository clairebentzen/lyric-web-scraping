Hozier Lyrics
"Sunlight"
I would shun the light
Share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, the tale is the same
Told before and told again
A soul that's born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
At last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was something foreknown to me, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
Each day you rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad, happily
With wax melted I'd meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Hozier said in his Amazon Side by Side commentary, that this song has similar audio elements as does
"Work Song"
from his debut album.
These lyrics contain references to ancient Greek myth of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun and fell from the heights.

All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom

Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried

The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit

Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid, hmm?

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool...
