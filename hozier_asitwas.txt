Hozier Lyrics
"As It Was"
There is a roadway
Muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd had life enough
My heart is screaming of
And in a few days
I will be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me
Is yours just as it was
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the flame
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
Tell me if somehow
Some of it remains
How long you would wait for me
How long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now
Your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me about your day
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the shame
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too

Hozier said of this song,
"It's about reassuring somebody upon your returning, comparing all the wonderful things you've experienced and being able to only compare how marvelous it was to this person you're talking to. There's a sense of foreboding to it as well."
This track was described by Hozier in his Reddit "Ask Me Anything" as a "sibling song" to his previous
"It Will Come Back"

Holy water cannot help you now
Thousand armies couldn't keep me out

Young The Giant - "Silvertongue"
Trying to think of a way to get started
Stutter my flow
Train of thought just departed
Taste of mezcal on my breath
Let me get this off your chest
Open my mouth
All the gems falling out
Make you lose...
George Ezra - "Hold My Girl"
I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
'Bout everything that you're going through
My girl you've got nothing to lose

Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
You're scaring us and all of us, some of us love you

Mitski - "Cop Car"
I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I want to jump into blue water
And I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
