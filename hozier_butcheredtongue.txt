Hozier Lyrics
"Butchered Tongue"
As a child it was the place names
Singing at me as the first thing
How the mouth must be employed
In every corner of itself
To say "Appalacicola"
Or "Hushpukena" like "Gweebara"
A promise softly sung of somewhere else
And as a young man
Blessed to pass so many road signs
And have my foreign ear made fresh again
On each unlikely sound
But feel at home
Hearing a music
That few still understand
A butchered tongue still
Still singing here above the ground
The ears were chopped
From young men
If the pitch-cap didn't kill them
They are buried
Without scalp
In the shattered bedrock of our home
You may never know your fortune
Until the distance has been shown between
What is lost forever
And what can still be known
So far from home
To have a stranger call you darling
And have your guarded heart
Be lifted like a child up by the hand
In some town that just means
'Home' to them
With no translator left to sound
A butchered tongue
Still singing here above the ground

Matt Corby - "Resolution"
I’m giving up
This whole lie, this whole me
Call it out like a family
Instead I bide my time, get a ride
Until the rubber leaves the road

You said don’t lie so I made the truth
Seemed like a lie to...
Lorde - "Green Light"
I do my make-up in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

The 1975 - "Somebody Else"
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with...
Sam Smith - "I'm Not The Only One"
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be...
Bon Iver - "Skinny Love"
Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all...
