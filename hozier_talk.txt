Hozier Lyrics
"Talk"
I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found
Hey yeah
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground
Hey yeah
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around
Hey yeah
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you
I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love
Hey yeah
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of
Hey yeah
That's found in the last witness before the wave hits
Marvelling at God
Hey yeah
Before he feels alone one final time
And marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

Hozier told about this song during the album release party,
"There's all these lofty notions of, kind of, of true love, and lofty tales and kind of romantic language is used in the verses. And the chorus just admits to, like, 'I'm only using this language to distract from the fact that I'm trying to seduce you here, for fear that you find out how I'm imagining you.'"
This song has a reference to the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, his wife, who died and whom he wanted to rescue from the Underworld, i.e. Hades.

This party's pretty boring
I don't think it's for me

She's on the spare settee
