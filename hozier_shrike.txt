Hozier Lyrics
"Shrike"
I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
The words hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn
I had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now
Dragging along
Follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn
I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
I was housed by your warmth
Thus transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

Mitski - "Class Of 2013"
Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for...
Lorde - "Writer In The Dark"
Break the newsâ€”you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to...
Young The Giant - "Call Me Back"
When I was just a boy
By the phone, by the phone
My head was stuck in the clouds
Feet would not touch the ground
You didn't have to leave that way

Cause I was just
Just...
Wild Rivers - "Thinking 'bout Love"
Guess we caught up with telling a lie
Now you're leaving me lonely
I could get in my car and get drunk at some bar
But that was the old me
Remember the night that we slept on the floor
And you told...

Day off in Kyoto, got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11

I wanted to go but I didn't
You called me from a payphone, they still got pay...
