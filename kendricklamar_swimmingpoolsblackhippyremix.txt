Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Swimming Pools (Black Hippy Remix)"
(feat. Black Hippy)
[Ab-Soul:]
Players always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga
Get you a table my nigga
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
[Jay Rock:]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up 'til you throw up
Like a bulimic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, OK let's toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
[Ab Soul:]
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin' off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soulo)
Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
[ScHoolboy Q:]
So it's that groovy little nigga
Known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick
Bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged out king, yeah, nigga, I'm Puff, uh
Have that pussy throbbing
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that
Twisting off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck with Goose
Can I get a shot, swim in your juice
Worth a stack a minute, every day that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet
Bitch, did you see your tab receipt?
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
(Sherane)
Aw man... where is she taking me
Where is she taking me
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
More, more, bless me more
We gon' drink this motherfucker down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it 'round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Bless me more
We gon' drink this motherfucker down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it 'round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
