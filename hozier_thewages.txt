"The Wages" lyrics
Hozier Lyrics
"The Wages"
Although many contend
You may find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Whether the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages
And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else
And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prison
With scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
