Hozier Lyrics
"From Eden"
Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me
No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me
Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door
Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin
Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this.
Oh, what a sin
To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree
Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door
Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door

The Lumineers - "Flowers In Your Hair"
When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair

See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was...
Wet - "Don't Wanna Be Your Girl"
It's just not right

I don't wanna be your girl no more
I just wanna see your face at home

You can't do me right
So I, decide that
I don't wanna be your girl no more, no
I just wanna see you up and...
Maggie Rogers - "On + Off"
I'm coming up slowly
I'm high on emotion
With waves of this feeling
As wide as the ocean
And then I see you
When I feel like I'm drowning
And then I see you
It's OK, it's OK, I'm OK, I'm alright...
Colony House - "Julia"
I hear many beautiful songs but the chords that I strum cannot carry them
Notes falling in the wind
I see many beautiful works turn to ashes and dirt
And I bury them
Deeper than a memory
I dream many...
Ray LaMontagne - "I Was Born To Love You"
You give me a sign, you give me a lift
Take me home when I'm done my shift
You give me a loan when I'm stone cold broke
Get me high when I need a toke

I was born to love
I was born to
I was born to...
