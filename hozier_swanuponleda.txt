Hozier Lyrics
"Swan Upon Leda"
A husband waits outside
A crying child pushes a child into the night
She was told he would come this time
Without leaving so much as a feather behind
To enact at last the perfect plan
One more sweet boy to be butchered by men
But the gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men
The swan upon Leda
Empire upon Jerusalem
A grandmother smuggling meds
Past where the god child-soldier Setanta stood dead
Our graceful turner of heads
Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread
Someone's frightened boy waves her on
She offers a mother's smile and soon she's gone
The gateway to the world
The gun in a trembling hand
Where nature unmakes the boundary
The pillar of myth still stands
The swan upon Leda
Occupier upon ancient land
The gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men

Hozier explained on Twitter on the 4th of October, 2022,
"I wrote 'Swan Upon Leda' in Ireland a year ago and recorded it recently with producer Jenn Decilveo. We were tracking it in studio when the news came through of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I felt there was an opportunity to offer some show of solidarity. We're reminded again by the protests in Iran that progressivism is a global movement. The recent pushbacks against civil liberties and human rights respect no boundaries or borders, and like all acts of control, violence and indeed all forms of occupation, their legacies can be immeasurable in both the personal and political spheres."
The song was released three days later as the first taste of his album "Unreal Unearth".
The title of this song refers to the ancient Greek myth of Zeus (in the form of a swan) raping Leda as a punishment for becoming Queen of Sparta.

Well, did you miss me?

I think I've had enough

Oh I like it when it's early
