Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"
[Kendrick Lamar:]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
[Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise):]
(Bitch, don't kill my vibe)
(Bitch, don't kill my vibe)
(Walk out the door and they scream it's alive)
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
[Death to Molly]
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!
