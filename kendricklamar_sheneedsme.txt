Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"She Needs Me"
(feat. Javonte)
One time, reporting live, Compton, California
[Kendrick Lamar:]
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that'll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible, she's independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me
[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
[Kendrick Lamar:]
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I'm outdated
She's dating one of Hollywood's famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
I need her, we need we
[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

Isaiah Rashad - "Shot You Down"
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, it's reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, role model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them...
Frank Ocean - "Biking"
Uh, turn, what goes around comes around
Ayy, turn, turn the music up, uh, yeah
Goes around comes around
What goes, alright, like like
Life goes in cycles
Everything that comes around goes around...
Big K.R.I.T. - "The Vent"
A mother lost her child, I tried to ease her pain
"It's only God's will", she says she felt the same
It's funny how the sun will up and bow to rain
As if the clouds couldn't stand to see me outside...
