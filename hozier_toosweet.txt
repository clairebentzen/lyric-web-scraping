Hozier Lyrics
"Too Sweet"
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's ten o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smelling like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish that I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong
You know you're bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

Leith Ross - "I'd Have To Think About It"
I know that I will love again
I'll meet someone and I'll make amends
I'm sure she'll be a gentleman
And I will be content

I know that I would be fulfilled
See the world and pay my bills
Have a drink...
Of Monsters And Men - "Wolves Without Teeth"
Open my chest and colour my spine
I'm giving you all
I'm giving you all
Swallow my breath
And take what is mine
I'm giving you all
I'm giving you all

I'll be the blood
If you'll be the bones
I'm...
Sufjan Stevens - "The Only Thing"
The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I...
Chance Pe√±a - "Highs & Lows"
We walked through the waters
The shallow's gettin' colder
I know this is harder
Outside of new love's protection
Commitment ain't easy
With two hearts beatin'
Gotta dance through the seasons
Whatever...
Vance Joy - "Georgia"
She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul, oh

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
