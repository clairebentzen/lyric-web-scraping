Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"I Do This"
(feat. Jay Rock)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis Letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, mamma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Uh, so give me fifty-feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know their seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT-crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud-9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
[Jay Rock:]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
First off I'm a rider, bitch
Put them 26s on a Silverado, bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubik's Cube when I roll up
OK, "Subway" bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
