Hozier Lyrics
"De Selby (Part 1)"
At last
When all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God at the start couldn't bear
And sit unseen
With only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowing yourself
With all mirroring gone from the world
But still the mind
Rejecting this new empty space
Fills it with something or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Trína chéile: le chéile claochlaithe
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Is claochlú an ealaín
Is ealaín dubh í
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Trína chéile: le chéile claochlaithe
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Is claochlú an ealaín
Is ealaín dubh í

Lizzy McAlpine - "hate to be lame"
It's always on the tip of my tongue
I read an article on the internet
Told me that that's how you know you're falling in love
Don't really trust what's on the internet
But maybe just this once

Bon Iver - "Blood Bank"
Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags

You said, "See look at it: that's yours

Leith Ross - "We'll Never Have Sex"
Depollute me, pretty baby
Suck the rot right out of my bloodstream
Oh, dilute me, gentle angel
Water down what I called being grateful

Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to take me home
It was...
The Fray - "How To Save A Life"
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left...
Oh Wonder - "Don't You Worry"
We walked the city streets at midnight when the world went quiet
We skipped our dancing feet along beside the taxi rides
If I'm honest, it felt like love

Then all the beats fell in between the...
