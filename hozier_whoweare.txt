Hozier Lyrics
"Who We Are"
You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has a cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop
What I had left here
I just held it tight
So someone with your eyes
Might come in time
To hold me like water
Or Christ
Hold me like a knife
We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are
You and I burned out our steam
Chasing someone else's dream
How can something be so much heavier
But so much less than what it seems
Darling we sacrificed
We gave our time to something undefined
This phantom life
It sharpens like an image
But it sharpens like a knife
We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are
You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has its cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop

Kodaline - "Talk"
I can remember the good old days,
Where you and me, we used to hide away
Where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes

Yeah, you filled up my glass

boygenius - "Letter To An Old Poet"
I said I think that you're special
You told me once that I'm selfish
And I kissed you hard
In the dark
In the closet

You said my music is mellow
Maybe I'm just exhausted
You think you're a good...
High Highs - "Bridge"
When unto this country
With a waking eye

Oh the spike was on my nerve
Was in my eye

When unto this substance
At the river end

Oh the bridge was pulled back up
Into the sky

The Paper Kites - "Featherstone"
Wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart
Wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart

Tom Odell - "Grow Old With Me"
I can feel you breathing
With your hair on my skin
As we lie here within
The night

I'll pull the sheets
When it's cold on your feet
Cause you'll fall back to sleep
Every time

Grow old with me
