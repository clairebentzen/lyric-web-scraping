Hozier Lyrics
"Like Real People Do"
I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth?
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags, 
I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone beat down on bony backs
So far from home where the ocean stood 
Down...
The 1975 - "Fallingforyou"
What time you coming out?
We starting losing light.
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me around,
I'm so excited for the night,
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday...
Wrabel - "Poetry"
It was that summer
I learned your number
Like it was my own
I still remember
That first September
Driving you home

And oh my, my, my
It's a big, big, big world out there
And looking for something

Young The Giant - "Superposition"
I don't believe in fate
No psychic vision
But when things fall into place
Superposition

In any universe
You are my dark star

I want you
To want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we...
Caamp - "Fall, Fall, Fall"
Will you fall, fall, fall for your furies
Would you die on the blade like your daddy did
Will you not stop and shake from this worry
Would you stay on the line while your country died
