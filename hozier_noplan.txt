"No Plan" lyrics
Hozier Lyrics
"No Plan"
For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words
A cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving, fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name
To the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothin'
And honey, if nothin's gained?
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me
'Cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire
Hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me
And if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble
Marvel at flowers you'll have made
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't have hoped to know, but here I stand
There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

This song was inspired by Lawrence M. Krauss, the physicist who believed that we should be happy just because we're having this chance to live on Earth. Hozier also told The Irish Times, that he was influenced by a lecture "Death of a Universe" by Dr. Katie Mack, an astrophysicist. He explained on iTunes,
"This song is a squeeze of the hand, saying, 'Whatever your neuroses and your problems are, don't even worry about it. There will be darkness again.'"
Booker T. Jones, who collaborated with Hozier on this album, said upon first hearing of this track, that is was "a cosmic tune", according to Hozier in an Instagram Q+A.

Hold

FINNEAS - "New Girl"
Crush, who's got a crush?
I like the way you blush
I like the way you bite
Touch, each time we touch
I wanna take too much
Keep me up all night

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove...
Of Monsters And Men - "Alligator"
I see color
Raining down
Feral feeling
Swaying sound
But I don't know what you want

I am open
I am restless
Let me feel it out
Let it all come out

Wake me up
I'm fever dreaming
And now I lose...
The Regrettes - "I Dare You"
I never wanted to get too close to you
But now it looks like I'm getting too close to you
My mom tries to catch me
But I know all the backstreets
There's a look that you give me, a switch
On my fear...
Caamp - "Officer Of Love"
Baby blue bandana drives by in a pickup truck
Got a white stripe right down her side, tires on the mud

She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
She is an officer of love and I'll obey...
