Hozier Lyrics
"Be"
When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the Gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singing
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicing shame
When the earth is trembling on some new beginning
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered sin (lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be the hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (lover, be good to me)
That's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost
Oh lover, be good to me
When the man who gives the order
Is born next time around on the boat sent back
When the bodies starving at the border
Are on TV giving people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh when there's nothing left for you and I to do
Oh when there's nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you now
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be love in its disrepute (lover, be good to me)
That scorches the hillside and salts every root (lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowing and starving of troops
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
(Lover, be good to me)

"Be" has references to the Bible, e.g. Genesis, Saint Peter and the Gates of Heaven. Hozier explained the chorus in an interview with Entertainment,
"It's about the myth of the Garden of Eden, about original sin. That myth is about two human beings being told what not to do and, in doing it, they perform an act of love, which upsets a greater power than themselves and they are cast out. I'm viewing their actions instead as liberating, and as a very necessary action. It's not so much a sin as a vital act of protest."
The line
"When the gyre widens"
may be a reference to William Butler Yeats's poem "The Second Coming".
When asked by a fan on Twitter about the line when he mentions Adam, Hozier answered,
"Well. I figure that lad had an awful surprise on his hands is all."

Brandi Carlile - "Raise Hell"
I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak.
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet.
But Gabriel done came to me
And kissed me in my sleep,
And I'll be...
Tom Odell - "Heal"
Take my mind and take my pain,
Like an empty bottle takes the rain.

And heal, heal, heal, heal.

And take my past and take my sins,
Like an empty sail takes the wind.

And heal, heal, heal, heal....

I danced in the desert, in the pouring rain
Drank with the devil and forgot my name
Woke with somebody when the morning came
No one there to shame me for my youth
Cause I wouldn't be with you

Stop, drop and drag me into place
And lock the fire escapes

Yeah, yeah

I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad, it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm...
