Hozier Lyrics
"Say My Name"
(originally by Destiny's Child)
Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh". "yeah ok"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
That I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?
And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)
Why don't you just tell the truth?
(Somebody's there then tell me who)
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house
And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)
Why don't you just tell the truth?
(Somebody's there then tell me who)
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
Say my name, say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
No one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Why the sudden change?
No one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
No one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Honey, say my name

The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child

So...
Maggie Rogers - "Dog Years"
I count my time in dog years
Swimming in sevens
Slow dancing in seconds
Oh and I'm the one that loves you
Oh and I'm the one that loves you
I spend my time daydreaming
As sure as the sea
It's just...
Florence + The Machine - "Tiny Dancer"
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny...
Jessie Reyez & 6LACK - "IMPORTED"
Hi, my name is 6LACK
And sometimes people call me SIX-LACK
I don't mind because they stubborn
And my bank account is looking mighty fine, ayy
We can skip the wine and dine
Go straight for the wind...
LÃ‰ON - "In A Stranger's Arms"
Weeks go so slow
We haven't spoken one word
Been an endless summer
I go out and get home
My neighbors leaving for work
I don't mind them judging

I got nowhere to go
Call everyone I know
'Cause I go...
