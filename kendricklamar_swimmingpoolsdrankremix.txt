Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Swimming Pools (Drank) (Remix)"
(feat. Lloyd & August Alsina)
[Lloyd:]
I'm way past gone, and I just see the bottom of this bottle
I just woke up to a room full of models
Who know that I ain't calling them tomorrow
It's been so long, since I have been on this level right here
Waking up, after I pass out, I put my clothes on, before I mash out
'Cause I've been losing my mind, wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in aside
Playing the part and feeling them lies
Shawty says she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Next in my room, I hit her from behind
Doing and doing like I'm pressing rewind
'Cause I have never babysitting, I be lining up shots
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I wash them apart
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it all
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now I done grew up
'Round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'm 'a get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'm 'a drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm 'a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm 'a dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

No more excuses,...

Tell me what you niggas know...
