Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Keisha's Song (Her Pain)"
(feat. Ashtro Bot)
[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet
[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
[Kendrick Lamar:]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Under covers, the dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin' off police
[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
[Kendrick Lamar:]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song, mm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play
[Ash Riser:]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Big K.R.I.T. - "The Vent"
A mother lost her child, I tried to ease her pain
"It's only God's will", she says she felt the same
It's funny how the sun will up and bow to rain
As if the clouds couldn't stand to see me outside...
Jay-Z - "4:44"
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day

Why do I keep on running away?

Took for my child to be born,...

Taxi driver

Leave the meter running

I told him, "Don't curse me"...
