Hozier Lyrics
"Dinner & Diatribes"
Honey this club here is stuck up
Dinner and Diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eye
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer hell if you'd tell me
What you'd do to me tonight
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
Honey I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar, I am upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking what
You'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what
You'd do to me tonight
Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love...
Ohhhh
Let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
Ohhhh
Let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
