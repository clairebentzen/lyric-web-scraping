Hozier & Bedouine Lyrics
"That You Are"
One, two, three
It's the sound of it that brings me there
This city locked into the song of prayer
That finds no melody
Every moment of the working day
The twitching muscles in each step I take
The prayer is all of me
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are
That you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are
That you are
Maybe I have yet to venture out
See the places that I hear about
Planes and trains and cars
Carve their lines into a curve like blades
All I get to are mistakes half-made
Leave the door ajar
But I'd be
Anywhere that you are
That you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are
You are
The prayer
Is all of me
All of me
The prayer
Is all of me
All of me
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are
That you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are
That you are

Wallows - "Are You Bored Yet?"
"What's wrong?" you've been asking
But I don't have an answer
How come, I'm still thinking
Let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that...
The Lumineers - "Ophelia"
Ah, ah, when I was younger, I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse, and you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend, he feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse,...
Delaney Bailey - "J's Lullaby (Darlin' I'd Wait For You)"
Darling, I'd wait for you
Even if you didn't ask me to
Tie a lasso 'round the Moon
And bring it on down to you
I'd bottle the feeling you give me
And shelve that stuff for years to come
'Cause baby,...
New West - "Those Eyes"
When we're out in a crowd laughing loud and nobody knows why
When we're lost at a club getting drunk and you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car and your hand touches mine
When we're...
The Last Dinner Party - "Nothing Matters"
I have my sentence now, at last, I know just how you felt
I dig my fingers in, expecting more than just the skin

'Cause we're a lot alike, in favour, like a motorbike
A sailor and a nightingale...
