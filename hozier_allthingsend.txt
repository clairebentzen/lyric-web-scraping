Hozier Lyrics
"All Things End"
A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right
The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"
And we will again
Moving on in time and taking more from everything that ends
And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again
I have never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by being somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad
When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends
And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again
We begin again, darling
And all things end
All that we intend is built of sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Won't change our plans
When we begin again
And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again

Odessa - "Hummed Low"
The green truck hummed low
Ah, we took only back roads
We drove miles of country
We saw an old barn burning

George Ezra - "Angry Hill"
He reads yesterday's news,
Cause today's just scares him.
Thinks of yesterday's blues,
Cause today's are just far too grim.
And it grows, on it grows.

And I see him down in the morning,
Lying blind...

She said "hello mister, pleased to meet ya"
I wanna hold her, I wanna kiss her

Morningsiders - "How Good It Is"
What the hell were we doing
Before we were in love?
Just think of all the wasted time
Just can't get enough

You never knew
How good it is
To be an admirer
How good it is
To feel your fire
How good...
