Hozier Lyrics
"In The Woods Somewhere"
My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name
'Til the fever broke
When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums
I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind
Be good to me
An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere
A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands
A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no word
No sound he made
His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone
To end his pain
What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes
Were watching me
The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life
I didn't have
Deer in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you
I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet
How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere

Lord Huron - "Meet Me In The Woods"
I took a little journey to the unknown,
And I come back changed. I can feel it in my bones.
I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see.
Now the darkness got a hold on me.
Oh, the darkness got a...
Declan McKenna - "Brazil"
I heard you sold the Amazon
To show the country that you're from
Is where the world should want to be for
Find something all people need
I'm faithless now
Though we win every time and I don't know...
Noah Kahan - "Sink"
Oh, she hates to say goodbye
So she only says goodnight
When she goes, she stops to look behind
And I'll sink
Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh no, yeah, summer...
James Bay - "Chew On My Heart"
Take your time, I'll be right here
I know no one could ever love me better
Take all night, you're the truth that is breaking me
And keeping me together, together

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so...
Palace - "Heaven Up There"
When the night has gone
And the shadows clear
When I hear my song
Will the grave be near?
See what you want
But I'm the rising tide
I'm no force of God
I'm a thousand lies
I take what I want
