Hozier Lyrics
"Empire Now"
Sun coming up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun coming up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from
Sun coming up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun coming up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from
After all, darling, I wouldn't sell the world
The way that things are turning
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burning
Sun coming up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun coming up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from
The martyrs of our revolution
Their spinning caused the earth to shake
The problem brought its own solution
They power now the world we've made
After all, darling, I wouldn't sell the world
For all the gold or sterling
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burning
Sun coming up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun coming up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from

Mt. Joy - "Jenny Jenkins"
We don't come down, we just stay up all year
Counting our vices dear, and the shit that got us here

No written rules or commandments
It was enough to...
Matt Maeson - "Beggar's Song"
Jesus, come talk to me
I am but a blind mess, I'm wild and free
I know that I need us more than I need me
One more whisky, I'm wild and free

Oh but I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one...
Bon Iver - "Lump Sum"
Sold my cold knot, a heavy stone
Sold my red horse for a venture home
To vanish on the bow
Settling slow

Fit it all, fit it in the doldrums
Or so the story goes
Color the era
Film it as...
Hippo Campus - "Warm Glow"
Smoke-swell haze on the hill over Tennessee
Leaky churches
Honey-burned tobacco leaves
Girl, teal-eyed, do occupy this tree with me
Summer peelings

The rose-set road will bend around
The earth you...
