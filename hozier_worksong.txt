Hozier Lyrics
"Work Song"
Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

The 1975 - "Fallingforyou"
What time you coming out?
We starting losing light.
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me around,
I'm so excited for the night,
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday...
Vance Joy - "Emmylou"
Oh, if you're losin' sleep
Oh, if you're losin' sleep, scared of shadows
Oh, see it's just a chair, see the clothes hang there
Oh, don't go losin' sleep, scared of shadows

Oh, don't feel bad

Lord Huron - "Fool For Love"
I'm leaving this place behind
And I'm heading out on the road tonight
I'm off for the hinterlands
Way up north where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride

Run away-ay with me
Lost souls in revelry

Pick yourself up kid
I can't bear the weight
Pick your mood upfront
We don't have the time
When you find someone
You don't run away
Pick yourself up kid

All those wicks in your head
Is that all this...
