Hozier Lyrics
"I, Carrion (Icarian)"
If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now
That I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden
Offered to us by the world
And though I burn
How could I fall?
When I am lifted by every word you say to me
If anything could fall at all
It's the world that falls away from me
You have me floating like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered
What was holding up the ground
I can see that all along, love
It was you all the way down
Leave it now
I am sky-bound
If you need to, darling
Lean your weight to me
We'll float away
But if we fall, I only pray
Don't fall away from me
I do not have wings, love
I never will
Soaring over a world you are carrying
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion
If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
If I should fall on that day
I only pray
Don't fall away from me

George Ezra - "Fell In Love At The End Of The World"
You take off all your clothes and you beckon me in
And I pray I don't forget the way that this all begins
The lavender's burning, the candles are lit
There's a war outside, but it can't get us here...
Leith Ross - "To Learn"
What can I say?
I'm learning to lie
But I'm living to learn
What to lie about

I'm losing again
From holding too tight
But I'm living to lose
What I can do without

I've played a few games
Where no...
Imagine Dragons - "Demons"
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide...
Noah Kahan - "The View Between Villages (Extended)"
Air in my lungs 'til the road begins
As the last of the bugs leave their homes again
And I'm splittin' the road down the middle
For a minute, the world seemed so simple

Feel the rush of my blood,...
The Paper Kites - "Featherstone"
Wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart
Wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart
When you go, what you leave is a work of art
On my chest, on my heart

She went out to the hay in the morning...
