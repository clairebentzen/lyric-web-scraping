Hozier Lyrics
"Francesca"
Do you think I'd give up
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink
How could you think darling I'd scare so easily?
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm
Since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?
If someone asked me at the end
I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again
For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease
Ours never knew peace
What good would it be on the far side of things?
But it was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip taking hold
Like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes
Though I know my heart would break
I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I

Family Of The Year - "Hero"
Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with...
The Paper Kites - "Till The Flame Turns Blue"
I want to get back to you, baby
I want to get back to those times
When we used to go downtown and just
And we'd burn until the flame turned blue
So put on your dress and your makeup
We're gonna go...
5 Seconds Of Summer - "Amnesia"
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine

Are you somewhere...
Gregory Alan Isakov - "Saint Valentine"
Well, Grace she's gone, she's a half-written poem
She went out for cigarettes and never came home
And I swallowed the sun and screamed and wailed
Straight down to the dirt so I could find her trail...
The Lumineers - "Salt And The Sea"
One, two, three, four

Could it be I was the one that you held so deep in the night?
On the back staircase you fell to your knees with tears in your eyes

All that you suffered, all the disease
You...
