Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Year Of The Firesheep"
(feat. Schoolboy Q)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Said I'm a fucking monster
A massive attack will haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors mastered that
After that I went for thermometers
Popped them all then popped them in the jar
Tracy veronica holler back
They promise there's no pajamas
Insomnia when attack I attack like piranha
There's hit your block like a comet
And you all know what time it is 2012 mark your calendars
Calisthenics and silence is exercise
And that trigger strapped
Rock with us Metallica competition
No talent I'm in the jungle
Loud enough just might stumble
Upon a pack of lions no lying
My soldiers dying
This is like rap alliance is lining with
Stars and bars of a prison wrapped my science applying
Pressure a stretcher is needed paint prosthese of your living dead
Your stuff is a giga pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watching that TV
I'll hold your hug in my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit 'til I feel my breath start stinking my fucking chest
She fucking the fucking best mean my dick is the dick of death
Mean I'm killing that pussy like spike whenever that jerry slip
Yeah Dre
Me and Andre the giant 6'7" and climbing
Whether your storm to your climbing
Whether your beat making a rhyme and
Bumping some feelings huh man with a handful of diamonds like jay fans on an island with ray bans
Glasses, palmin' asses that probably came with a great tan
I'll be the motherfucking mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frogs rectum
While you're wrecking with irreputable my words so incredible
Probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera barely passing up Celicas
Telling us about shit
Hiii power in your mouth bitch
And top dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout
About face and army outfits the general's head
Means the hustlers and the criminals there
Pinnotens reach the pinnacle of life in despair
And me I solemnly swear
To handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never asking Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzing and still a pow for it
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory your pain bore me
You ain't really lived it
I'll take you to a block where they cripping
A piru that's 5'2" gun bigger than the torso of pippen
Bitch I been doing it since before you niggas ruined it
Show me something different
You either kissing dick or giving me distance
You live in a district of dime bags and dummies
I know your statistics
Who your bar he more like my assistant
Get lost have an egg and a biscuit
Break-fast when we aiming them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missing
Q, Q
[ScHoolboy Q:]
Ah, double up said what the fuck
Give me some I'll throw more popping
Sagrets dropping soon they watching
9s that's locked and load explode
Drugging ford I'm slowly known
Mary up some swisher sweets
LA nigga probably eats
Shrimp for the raging beats
XO, Henney, scrape the kief
Banging c I'll bang your beat
Put them niggas next to me
Stopping for them give the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
All them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence
Still I'm venting
Air condition coolest breezes, ill diseases
Grip my pen and shoot my semen
Still I'm coming
Mouths is running
I was learning getting knowledge
And describing she a goblin
We be mobbing over bitches
Sticking missus she the business
Ghetto witness pussy frenching
Just a mission popping off like on a mission
Proposition getting money drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Cop a head gon' bust nigga
Heating up the winter nigga
Something to remember nigga
Hella sick I gotta spit
Curse with a verse like God told me kill this shit
Load a clip Hecklin cops
The Hoover king
Ba da bing by the dingaling
Natural Hoover
Ving rhames with a vision clearer than Visine
Asian from Beijing
Money making Compton cream
Feed a weak that's when it stop
Start with rain drops
Autobots, space shuttle I'm shitting on your car lot
Boy stop
Could've at least got a Saturn huh
Hiii power see a pattern huh
Putting on chops like I've never been freed
Toon to the knees still I'm shooting up scenes
Cheese and a nigga thoughts succeed
Promising scenes ba da bing bing bing
