Hozier Lyrics
"In A Week"
(feat. Karen Cowley)
I have never known peace like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hunger's appeased, our heart beats becoming slow
We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw
And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, the flesh calmly going cold
We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep
And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle'd show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long, we'd become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle'd show fear (So long, we'd become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

James Bay - "Move Together"
Home now, end of the night
It's colder to turn on your side
And I know you're up in two hours
But we didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So don't ruin now.

How we gonna move together? Just...
Bahamas - "All The Time"

I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you

Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper
Still,...

I know the West was won this way
But God forgive the heartless way we let
It all burn down

Godspeed my love

She's the only one around
And she's turning off the lights
And she's inside every crack

She's the only one I see
And she's flying through the air
She's the dust upon...
