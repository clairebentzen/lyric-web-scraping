Hozier Lyrics
"The Parting Glass"
(Live from the Late Late Show)
Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
For all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But as it falls unto my lot
That I must go and you must not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

Don't like to think for myself all of the time
And be my soul
Look into these eyes like no one before
Be my light
Sunrise laughing cause we stayed up all night
Be my map
We'll leave with...
COIN - "Crash My Car"
Walk in like a wrecking ball
The way she moves make you miserable
All eyes on the golden girl
She's gonna tell you, gonna tell you, gonna tell you
That you're too sweet
Swan dive to the concrete...
HAIM - "The Steps"
So baby, when I'm near you
You can't feel me, I'm lightnin'
You used to come by
And sit down by my side
You would come in close
And take off all my clothes

Every time I think that I've been takin'...
