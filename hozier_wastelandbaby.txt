"Wasteland, Baby!" lyrics
Hozier Lyrics
"Wasteland, Baby!"
All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns
That all words in the fight fell to
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby
And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
To the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's wasteland, baby
When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Are an end but the start of all things that are left to do
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
(That's it)

Hozier explained to Billboard the meaning of this track by saying,
"It's dealing with the absolute worst-case scenario to a comical point. [If] it's an absurd love song that's about the world ending in no metaphorical way, at least make it a whistle-able tune... You get great results out of just approaching that light and dark."
The singer told NME,
"While there's other songs on there that have doom and gloom and might touch upon it, 'Wasteland, Baby!' goes straight for it. It lets us imagine how the worlds might end in a very real sense. But as long as there's people, that 'You and I', there's always potential for kindness, and that is something to be hopeful about."

Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

Even harmless in death

Mitski - "Pink In The Night"
I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you

Well I guess I'll have to fall in love with strangers

You give me a sign, you give me a lift
Take me home when I'm done my shift
