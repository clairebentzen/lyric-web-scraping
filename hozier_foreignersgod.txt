Hozier Lyrics
"Foreigner's God"
She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs
Always a well-dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief
Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her
All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Cage The Elephant - "Ain't No Rest For The Wicked"
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, "I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?

Mumford & Sons - "The Cave"
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you...
Gregory Alan Isakov - "If I Go, I'm Goin"
This house
She's holding secrets
I got my change behind the bed

In a coffee can
I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave

And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go...
George Ezra - "Hold My Girl"
I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
'Bout everything that you're going through
My girl you've got nothing to lose

Cold nights
And the Sunday mornings
On your way and out...
Mother Mother - "It's Alright"
Oh, it's alright, oh

Oh hey, I had a night I had a day
I did one million stupid things
I said one billion foolish things
I'm not okay, I got a baseball bat beside my bed
To fight off what's inside...
