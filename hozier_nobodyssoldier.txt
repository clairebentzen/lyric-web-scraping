Hozier Lyrics
"Nobody's Soldier"
Running with bulls
Working my miracles
Holding my world together with a boot string
Living the dream
Benzos and gasoline
Coffee and blue light screens till the morning
If I tell you this is drowning
You tell me I'm walking on water
I could bring fire from the mountain
You tell me it feels a little colder
And I don't wanna
Choose between
Being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older
Let me step a little bolder
Choose between
Being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders
I'm gonna be nobody's soldier
Sick to my skin
Watching the news again
Whatever you choose, you lose out in the long run
The paint on the walls
Come down like a waterfall
The goal I was aiming for was the wrong one
If I say that this is drowning
You tell me I'm walking on water
I could bring fire from the mountain
You tell me it feels a little colder
And I don't wanna
Choose between
Being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older
Let me step a little bolder
Choose between
Being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders
I'm gonna be nobody's soldier
Nobody's soldier
Mmm, being a butcher
Nobody's soldier
Or a pauper, I'm
Nobody's soldier
I'm gonna be nobody's soldier
I don't wanna
Choose between
Being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older
Let me step a little bolder
Choose between
Being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders
I'm gonna be nobody's soldier

Vance Joy - "I'm With You"
I saw you standing there
Sandy-blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready to burst into flames for...
Bon Iver - "Beach Baby"
When you're out tell your lucky one
To know that you'll leave
But don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not to hear keys

Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed
Once a time...
Stephen Sanchez - "High"
Pull you underneath the slumber
Into the light before the thunder
Tell me, is there any wonder about where we stand?
Little honey in the summer, fell in love with Hunter
Oh, I can't have this

I'm...
Rainbow Kitten Surprise - "Cocaine Jesus"
Listen in it isn't when you're talking for your name's sake
Jesus, Mary Magdalene you are, are you okay?
Sitting by the well, Jill, your falling down the hill, Jack
And everybody laughed, Don't you...
Leith Ross - "We'll Never Have Sex"
Depollute me, pretty baby
Suck the rot right out of my bloodstream
Oh, dilute me, gentle angel
Water down what I called being grateful

Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to take me home
It was...
