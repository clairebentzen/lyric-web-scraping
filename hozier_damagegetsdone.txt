Hozier Lyrics
"Damage Gets Done"
(feat. Brandi Carlile)
Without shame
Two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go
And every desire for going there
I heard once
It's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor
And wake up feeling like a millionaire
Wish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)
You and I had nothing to show (We didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anything, darling)
And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
One time we would want for nothing (One time we had it all, love)
We knew what our love was worth (When we had nothing)
Now we're always missing something (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much
Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank was always filled up
Only enough for our getting there
(And you flew away) That first car was like wings on an angel
Before the whole wide world got too thin
(From me then) I swear goodwill kept up the engine
You were steering my heart like a wheel in your hands (Turn back, darling)
And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young

The Oh Hellos - "Second Child, Restless Child"
See, I was born the second child
With a spirit running wild, running free
And they saw trouble in my eyes
They were quick to recognize the devil in me

Gregory Alan Isakov - "The Fall"
The fall, the fall, the fall
I keep stumbling back

Ivory bone opera glass
Angles of attack
You heard blood was thick, brothers and sisters
But ya don't know where anybody's at
Time was a bust

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break

The Paper Kites - "Hurts So Good"
I can give up, I can get cold
I can get lost in a place that I call home
Well the night is still long, heavy like stone
Telling ourselves it's all we've ever known
Give a little love, take a little...
Tom Odell - "I Know"
Cold house, white light
Yellow lamps on blackened skies
Duffel hoods and deep brown eyes
I sing you a song that I think you'll like

And we'll walk to places we always go
A million faces I don't...
