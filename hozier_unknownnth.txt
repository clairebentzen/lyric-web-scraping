Hozier Lyrics
"Unknown / Nth"
You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me
Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags
They washed out in the mind of me
Where a blinding light shone on you every night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me
It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby, you know it's more the being unknown
So much of the living, love, is the being unknown
You called me angel for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat going unknown as any angel to me
Do you know, I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you?
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowing you
It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby
You know it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown

Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize

So I took my medication and I poured my trauma out
On some sad-eyed, middle-aged man's overpriced new leather couch

Pull up in your fast car

Is it time that you move on
Collect your bags from the doorstep
