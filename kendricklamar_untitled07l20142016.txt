"Untitled 07 L 2014 - 2016"
[Part I]
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Pimp-pimp! (Hooray!)
Pimp-pimp! (Hooray!)
(Hooray!)
Pimp-pimp! (Hooray!)

Love won't get you high as this
Drugs won't get you high as this
Fame won't get you high as this
Chains won't get you high as this
Juice won't get you high as this
Crew won't get you high as this

Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate, uh

Drugs won't get you high as this
Fame won't get you high as this
Chains won't get you high as this
Juice won't get you high as this
Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Life won't get you high like this here, no
He won't get you high like this here, no
She won't get you high like this here, no
"For Free?" won't get you high like this here, no
Two keys won't get you high, no, no, no
Bentleys won't get you high, like, no
Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Life won't get you high, no, no, no
He won't get you high, no, no, no
She won't get you high, no, no, no
"For Free?" won't get you high, no, no, no
Two keys won't get you high, no, no, no

Bars won't get you high, no, no, no
Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch, you
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch, you
Santa's reindeer better have some ass, you bitch, you
Everything I'm working, gotta be the gas, you bitch, you
(Don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck a...)
Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch

Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Me don't want problem (Me don't want problem)
Me don't want trick (Me don't want trick)

Me want it big (Me do want dollars)
Me don't want problem (We ride Impalas)
Me don't want trick (Me don't want trick)

[Part II]
[Egypt:]
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous 'til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you
[Part III]
[Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold:]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on (Hell yeah), come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
This is a fifteen minute song (Aha ha ha)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out (Shh)
Hundred thousand (Aw, yeah, aw, shit, ha ha ha ha)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody
Now I don't let you down, down for
You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, (Mhm) truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (ha ha ha ha)
Head is the answer (Yeah)
Head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself (Crazy, holy shit, ha ha ha)
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (Right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I said, girl, you make me wanna, uh
Great, the—the ho's screaming now, uh (ha ha ha ha)
I said baby you make
You make me wanna just, ah!
Baby, (ha ha ha ha) you got me speechless right now
(ha ha ha, you gotta take it there)
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Uh, said you just make me wanna drag you down
To the ground, to the ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Ju—you just make me wanna drag you down
To—down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And, baby, if your mama's around if your mama's around
If your mama's around if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination (ha ha), she young nigga chasin' (Aha hah!)
And she can get this dick too!
[Kendrick Lamar:]
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit man and watch what it's gon' do
