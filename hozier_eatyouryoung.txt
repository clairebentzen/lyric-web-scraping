Hozier Lyrics
"Eat Your Young"
I'm starving, darling
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carving, darling
I wanna smell the dinner cooking
I wanna feel the edges start to burn
Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the getting is gone
I won't lie, if there's something to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to it
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, Highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal
Honey, I'm making sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie, if there's something still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

"Eat Your Young" is the title track off of Hozier's EP "Eat Your Young". The song was released on his 33rd birthday, the 17th of March, 2023. He shared about it,
"It's always a gift to be able to release new music into the world and an added joy to do so on a birthday."
To tease the track, Hozier posted some hand-written chorus lyrics of it on Twitter on the 27th of February, 2023.
This track was inspired by the classic epic poem "Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri. Explaining his new music in a video posted on Facebook on the 10th of March, 2023, Hozier said,
"It's a sort of a taste of two on the nine circles: circle three and circle seven, I think, which is gluttony ('Eat Your Young') and heresy which is 'All Things End'."
