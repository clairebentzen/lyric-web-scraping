Hozier & Allison Russell Lyrics
"Wildflower And Barley"
Springtime in the country
Each time, I'm shocked by the light
The world lying fallow
And you are apart from me
Everything in my vision is movement and life
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower and barley
Springtime in the country
I can smell summer on its breath
Low and harrowed lie the fields and the heart of me
Everything in my vision, departure and death
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower and barley
(The healers)
This year, I swear it will be buried in actions
(Are healing)
This year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are digging the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
(I feel as useful as dirt) Useful as dirt
Put my body to work
Mmm (Ooh)
Mmm (Ooh)
Springtime in the city
The canal banks are empty again
The grass crying out to be heated by bodies
The streets for the laughter of young women and men
Canal boat and trolley
Wildflower and barley
(The healers)
This year, I swear it will be buried in actions
(Are healing)
This year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are digging the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
(I feel as useful as dirt) Useful as dirt
Unreal unearth
(The healers)
This year, I swear it will be buried in actions
(Are healing)
This year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are digging the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
(I feel as useful as dirt) Useful as dirt
Put my body to work
Mmm (Ooh)
Mmm (Ooh)
Springtime from my window
Another month has not much longer now
The sun hesitates more on each evening's darkening
With all things God allows remain above ground
Like grief and sweet memory
Wildflower and barley

"Wildflower And Barley" is one of unreleased tracks from Hozier's 2023 "Unreal Unearth" album sessions. The track was inspired by the first Circle of Hell from Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy".
This song was written during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Hozier explained in an interview with El Camino radio station,
"...referencing the stillness and the sort of eerie unhappy quiet of living in the countryside or living in the city, seeing empty streets, seeing empty roads. But I kind of wrote a playful song around that."

Cold bones, yeah, that's my love

FINNEAS - "I Lost A Friend"
I lost a friend
Like keys in a sofa
Like a wallet in the backseat
Like ice in the summer heat

I lost a friend
Like sleep on a red-eye
Like money on a bad bet
Like time worrying about every bad thing...
The Cinematic Orchestra - "To Build A Home"
There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust

This is a place where I feel at home.
