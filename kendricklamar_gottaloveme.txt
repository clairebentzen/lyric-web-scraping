Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Gotta Love Me"
(feat. Baby Keem)
[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm the type of nigga that get sexy on a bitch
VVS Presi' on a bitch
Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah
I'm the type of nigga that get sexy on a bitch
VVS clarity stone, Presi' on a bitch
And I'm feelin' like the hand of God blessed me in this bitch
Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch
I just won seven Grammies, girl, you gotta fuck me
And I got a song with Beyonc√©, you love me?
Poppin' wheelies on the freeway, I'm a stuntman
Got the city goin' crazy, look at what you done man
We just havin' fun man, T-O-P the gun man
D-O-T was on his level, vibin' in the function
100K for a walkthrough, why you talkin' to me?
Starin' at a dead president, they be talkin' to me, but look
I'm the type that get sassy on a bitch
One thing I can't stand is a messy lil' bitch
And a lotta y'all niggas undercover male groupies
105 with the window down, bumpin' Fugees
[Baby Keem (Kendrick Lamar):]
Doing what I want, yeah, I'm filthy
I'ma flex hard 'til it kill me
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome
(I'm the type that get sexy on a bitch)
(Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah)
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Big chillin' with my foolies and we all cool
Hit 'em with the whole foolie, we don't argue
You ain't hoppin' out on the mission, man, that's awful
You ain't countin' money, checkin' chicken, man, that's awful
And I got a car full of them female fossils
Lil' baby actin' fool with it, take a jaw full
I be drippin' sauce too, I done took a loss too
I done fell on my pocket, that's just what a boss do
Ain't nothin' to a full-time player on the deep end
Always on the deep end, I'm ballin' on the deep end
My acebooncoon say they callin' on the deep end
I'ma pledge to this whole dollar with allegiance
But I'ma get sassy on a bitch
Hit 'em with the wam-bam, break a levy on a bitch, yeah
I lift my shirt up, then I do my dance
I can manage for the cameras somehow
[Baby Keem (Kendrick Lamar):]
Doing what I want, yeah, I'm filthy
I'ma flex hard 'til it kill me
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome
(I'm the type that get sexy on a bitch)
(Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah)
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome
