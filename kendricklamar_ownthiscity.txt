Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Own This City"
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Talk about goals
Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
With a permanent flow
Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
And the couch is cold
And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
And your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove
And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
With a big room and a closet, 'cause it
Hurt when you laughing at his clothes
Looking at him like he ain't shit
Forever living in that commode
Time flies and I watch it tick
Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk
Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
Tripod then I aim it at your soul
For bright lights
Bite like a alligator when I write
Hungry, come see determination upon me
Come see the visionary in my sight
My life premeditated by ambition
Pistons from my Nikes take off
No assistance, I'm persistent
Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Let's talk about pressure
Let's talk about depression
Let's talk about desperate
Times
Everyday I'm guessin'
My mind, it'll never end up resting
I climb a ladder every second
I find another mountain top
Another video I watch when that video go off
I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand
Soldiers never could war off my talents
I wanna reassure my talents
I wipe my face but never throw my towel in
I'm often prowlin'
The edge of a quantum jump in my head
I'm a monster from anywhere but Earth
And I'm 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights
Bite like a bear trap when I write
Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
I took it off and ate it
I made it a full meal
And I'm still craving, my front teeth
I sink in the rap game
My name will attract fame
My veins got the blood of a king in it
When it pours down, now Snoop's on stage and he say
"Kendrick"
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
