Kendrick Lamar Lyrics
"Little Johnny"
[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Uh
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novocaine stabs
In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on 'em
Colours corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
His mamma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he might've been
A modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
More gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "The hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades hittin' licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour
The power of banging, he was walking from...(gunshots)
Little Johnny
[Malcolm X (Kendrick Lamar):]
I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will 'cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will 'cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It's something that the black man has to bring an end to
